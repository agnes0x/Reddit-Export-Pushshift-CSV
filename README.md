# Reddit Data Analysis 

## Intro
Export your selected subreddits from [Pushshift's archive of Reddit](https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/) into dataframes as well as .csv outputs

The resulting dataset is rich in detail and can also be aggregated on the minute-level, which is why it's such a popular datasource in various fields of research.
