# Reddit Data Analysis 

## Intro
Export your selected subreddits from [Pushshift's archive of Reddit](https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/) into dataframes as well as .csv outputs

The resulting dataset is probably one of the best Reddit dataset out there, as it's not only rich in detail, but can also be aggregated on a minute-level because of the timestamps.

## Use cases
There's a wide range of use cases: Use [sentiment analysis](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=reddit+sentiment+analysis&btnG=&oq=reddit+) to [uncover social or political attitudes](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0%2C5&cites=7671696188192149307&scipsc=1&q=reddit+social+politics&btnG=) or build [stock or crypto trading algorithms](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=reddit+stock+prediction&btnG=).
